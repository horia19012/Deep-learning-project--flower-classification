# Flower Recognition using CNN

A Convolutional Neural Network that classifies flower images into 5 categories: Lily, Orchid, Lotus, Sunflower, and Tulip.

## What it does

The project uses a deep learning CNN model to automatically recognize and classify different types of flowers from images. Images are preprocessed to 150x150 pixels, and the model is trained using data augmentation techniques to improve accuracy.

## Libraries Used

- **TensorFlow/Keras** - Deep learning framework for building and training the CNN
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations and array operations
- **OpenCV (cv2)** - Image processing and manipulation
- **Matplotlib** - Plotting training/validation accuracy and loss
- **Seaborn** - Statistical data visualization
- **Pillow (PIL)** - Image handling
- **tqdm** - Progress bars for data loading
